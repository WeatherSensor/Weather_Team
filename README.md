# Weather_Team
Here Is Team Project of EC 2023

Here's an overview of how the project will work
1- Hardware Setup:

2- Data Collection:
The Raspberry Pi will read data from the temperature and humidity sensors using and The collected data will be stored in variables for further processing and alerting

3- Alerting Mechanism:
the Raspberry Pi will determine whether the current readings indicate extreme conditions (e.g., too high or too low)

4- LED Indicators:
The LEDs connected to the GPIO pins will be used to indicate the alert status

5- Buzzer:
The buzzer connected to the GPIO pins will be used to generate an audible alert when extreme weather conditions are detected
